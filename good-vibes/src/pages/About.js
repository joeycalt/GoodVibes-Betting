    <p className='about'>Thank you for visting GoodVibes Betting. If you are not sure what this website is about, betting odds are basically odds placed on a game. The better the team, the odds are significantly in favor compared to the other team. Basically, if you place a bet on the better team, you would not get as much money back if the team wins compared to betting on the worse team and they win. However, at this site, all there is to show is every games odds within the MLB, NFL, and NHL. You would just load up the site, confirm you are over 21 years of age, and you will be brought to the home page. If you do not reach the age requirement, youl will be sent to the restricted page and you will not be able to enter. If you are old enough, once you are greeted by the homepage, you will see live scores for each league. From there you will be able to click the league on the navagation bar or the image of the league. At that page, there will be games show all with a dropdown menu. You will be able to click which ever game you want and there will be a dropdown that displays all the betting odds for each bookmaker in the country.

# Project-3

## Project Description 
My app is called GoodVibes Betting. In this app users will get a refreshing new and easy way to receive sports odds for Football, Baseball, and Hockey. When the user first loads the site they will be greeted with three images regarding each sport, and will also see live scores. The user can click whichever image they want, and be brought to that sports page. This is where the user will be given the odds for each game. If the user would like to look for odds in a different sport, they will be able to use the navigation bar up top and go to the sport they desire.

## User Stories
- As a user, there will be pictures of the three sports the app works with and live scores, once the page is loaded. 
- The user then could click a sports image, which will send them to the show page of the specific sport.
- Lastly, the user will then be able to return to the home page or another sports page for more odds.

### MVP Goals
- Some goals I have for this app is to show live scores on the home page.
- Be able to show live betting odds on the show page after each refresh.

### Stretch Goals (if applicable)
- In the future, I would like to filter by any team the player desires with a search bar up top. Once the search goes through, the page will list all of the teams upcoming games and odds.
- Give the app some pagination so the user does not have to continuously scroll.
